# mini-bf-interpreter

Basically a fully functional Brainf\*\*k interpreter written in TypeScript but as small as possible. If you can get it smaller, let me know!

To run:

```bash
bun run src/index.ts
```

Here's some Brainf\*\*k code you can try:
```bf
>++++++++[<+++++++++>-]<.>+++[<++++++++++>-]<-.+++++++..+++.>++++++++[<---------->-]<++.
```

If you wanna use an actual Brainf\*\*k interpreter that doesn't suck and has cool features, checkout [bfi](https://github.com/itsamedood/bfi)!
